#  LinearSVC on Moons Dataset

This project implements a **LinearSVC classifier** trained on the `make_moons` dataset from scikit-learn.  
The main highlight of this project is the use of **Polynomial Features** combined with a **Pipeline**, making the code clean, modular, and easy to extend.

## Results
- **Accuracy:** 97.65%  
- **Training samples:** 10,000  
- **Test ratio:** 0.2 (80% training, 20% testing)  
- **Noise level of the data:** 0.2

## 🚀 Key Features
- ✅ Used **Polynomial Features** to capture non-linear decision boundaries.  
- ✅ Implemented a **Pipeline** to streamline preprocessing, scaling, feature transformation, and model training.  
- ✅ Added **StandardScaler** for feature normalization.  
- ✅ Split the dataset using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.  
- ✅ Set hyperparameters carefully to achieve high accuracy.
